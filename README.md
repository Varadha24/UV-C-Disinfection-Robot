# UV-C-Disinfectant-Robot
Developed a fully autonomous UV-C disinfection robot prototype for hospital wards, powered by Raspberry Pi and programmed in Python. Utilized LiDAR for localization, ultrasonic sensors for close-range obstacle detection, IMU and motor encoders for accurate movement tracking, and a relay-controlled 360° UV-C lamp system for comprehensive surface and air disinfection. The robot navigated using a predefined ward map with waypoint planning, integrated safety features such as PIR human detection, obstacle-triggered UV-C shutdown, and an emergency stop button. Demonstrated the solution in a scaled-down hospital ward model, achieving reliable autonomous operation, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and full disinfection coverage.

#FEATURES:

* Map-Based Navigation using LiDAR & preloaded ward map.

* 360° Disinfection covering all surfaces and air.

* Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance using LiDAR + ultrasonic fusion.

* Human Safety via PIR sensors, emergency stop, and UV interlocks.
