# UV-C-Disinfection-Robot
This repository contains the code and documentation for our final year engineering project: an autonomous UV-C disinfection robot designed for hospital isolation wards. 
The robot utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller for control and leverages UV-C light technology for efficient surface sterilization.

#FEATURES:

*Autonomous Navigation: Employs line following and obstacle detection algorithms for self-directed movement within isolation wards. (Code and configuration files included)

*UV-C Disinfection: Utilizes strategically placed UV-C lamps for 360-degree disinfection of surfaces and airborne pathogens.

*Arduino Uno Control: Leverages Arduino Uno for central control, sensor integration, and decision-making. (Code included)

*Sensor Integration: Integrates infrared and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and safe navigation. (Sensor configuration details provided)

#HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

*Arduino Uno microcontroller

*L298N motor driver

*UV-C lamps

*Infrared and ultrasonic sensors (models and wiring details provided)

*Additional components (e.g., motors, wheels, chassis)

#SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

*Arduino IDE
